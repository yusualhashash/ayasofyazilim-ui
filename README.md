## Usage

### 💻 Developing

```console
pnpm dev
```

```console
pnpm test
```

### 🏗️ Building

Build package with `tsup` for production.

```console
pnpm build
```

### ▶️ Running files written in TypeScript

To execute a file written in TypeScript inside a Node.js environment, use the `tsx` command. This will detect your `tsconfig.json` and run the file with the correct configuration. This is perfect for running custom scripts while remaining type-safe.

```console
pnpm tsx ./path/to/file.ts
```

This is useful for running scripts, starting a server, or any other code you want to run while remaining type-safe.

### 🖇️ Linking

Often times you want to `link` this package to another project when developing locally, circumventing the need to publish to NPM to consume it.

In a project where you want to consume your package run:

```console
pnpm link my-package --global
```

Learn more about package linking [here](https://pnpm.io/cli/link).

### 📩 Committing

When you are ready to commit simply run the following command to get a well formatted commit message. All staged files will automatically be linted and fixed as well.

```console
pnpm commit
```

### 🔖 Releasing, tagging & publishing to NPM

Create a semantic version tag and publish to Github Releases. When a new release is detected a Github Action will automatically build the package and publish it to NPM. Additionally, a Storybook will be published to Github pages.

Learn more about how to use the `release-it` command [here](https://github.com/release-it/release-it).

```console
pnpm release
```

When you are ready to publish to NPM simply run the following command:

```console
pnpm publish
```

#### 🤖 Auto publish after Github Release (or manually by dispatching the Publish workflow)

❗Important note: in order to automatically publish a Storybook on Github Pages you need to open your repository settings, navigate to "Actions" and enable **"Read & write permissions"** for Workflows. Then navigate to "Pages" and choose **"GitHub Actions"** as the source for the Build and Deployment. After a successful deployment you can find your Storybook at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.

❗Important note: in order to publish package to NPM you must add your token as a Github Action secret. Learn more on how to configure your repository and publish packages through Github Actions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-nodejs-packages).
